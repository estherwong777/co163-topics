	    <p class="lead">This is an early model, the paper for which was published in 1975.</p>
	    <p>The Phong reflection model is an empirical model based on physical observations: in particular, Phong's observations regarding specular reflection and specular highlight. Specular highlights occur on an object where there is a bright spot on the material at a certain viewing angle. For metals, this is especially pronounced, due to its smooth and shiny surface, creating more distinct highlights, and most of the light reflection on metals is composed of specular reflection.

		<p>From his observations, Phong determined that the specular highlight was smaller and the edges more distinct for shiny surfaces than for more dull surfaces, where the highlight was larger and had a less distinct edge.
		</p>
		<p>In Phong's model, light reflection has three components: specular reflection, diffuse reflection, and ambient reflection, which are all summed to form the final BRDF.
		</p>
		<p><img src="images/phongVisual.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p> <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3APhong_components_version_4.png -->
		</p>
		<p>Diffuse reflection is affected by the texture of the suface of the object, and the effect of it is greater in objects which are dull with rough surfaces, as the microfacets in the surface will reflect light in many directions. Ambient light is equal in all directions, and so all surfaces are illuminated equally by ambient light. For each of these components, a constant coefficient is defined, the value of which is dependent on the incident light and the material:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>k<sub>s</sub> - specular reflection coefficient
		  <li>k<sub>d</sub> - diffuse reflection coefficient
		  <li>k<sub>a</sub> - ambient reflection coefficient
		</ul>
		<p>In an RGB model, the equation can be used to model the intensity of each colour separately, altering the k<sub>s</sub>, k<sub>d</sub> and k<sub>a</sub> constants depending on the colour.
		</p>
		<p>The light in a scene is also broken down into components corresponding to these three properties:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>i<sub>s</sub> - specular intensity
		  <li>i<sub>d</sub> - diffuse intensity
		  <li>i<sub>a</sub> - ambient intensity
		</ul>
		<p>The Phong model is dependent on four vectors: <img src="images/latex/unitN.svg" width="18" height="18">, <img src="images/latex/unitL.svg" width="18" height="18">, <img src="images/latex/unitV.svg" width="18" height="18">, and <imag src="images/latex/unitR.svg" width="18" height="18">. <img src="images/latex/unitN.svg" width="18" height="18"> represents the normal to the surface, <img src="images/latex/unitV.svg" width="18" height="18"> represents the light direction, <img src="images/latex/unitV.svg" width="18" height="18"> represents the viewing direction, and <img src="images/latex/unitR.svg" width="18" height="18"> represents the direction a perfectly reflected ray of light would take. Each of these are unit vectors, and are illustrated below:
		<img src=""> <!-- DIAGRAM SHOWING VECTORS AND ANGLES like https://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/illumin/specular_highlights/phong_model_specular_reflection.htm -->
		</p>
		<p>Considering just the ambient and diffuse reflectance, the ambient reflectance will depend on k<sub>a</sub> and I<sub>a</sub>. As for diffuse reflectance, the reflected intensity is not affected by the direction of the viewer, but depends solely on the direction of the light source with respect to the normal of the surface. Therefore, the diffuse reflectance is proportional to <img src="images/latex/cosTheta.svg" width="35" height="20">, where <img src="images/latex/theta.svg" width="10" height="20"> represents the angle between the normal and the light source. Using the scalar dot product and unit direction vectors for the normal and light, we can express the diffuse reflectance if we define the following variables:
		</p>
		<ul>
	      <li><img src="images/latex/unitN.svg" width="20" height="20"> - normal to the surface (unit vector)
		  <Li><img src="images/latex/unitL.svg" width="20" height="20"> - direction vector from point on surface to light source (unit vector)
		  <li><img src="images/latex/lightIntensity.svg" width="20" height="20"> - light source intensity
        </ul>
		<p>The equation so far for intensity of light at a point, only taking ambient and diffuse reflectance into account, can therefore be written:
		</p>
		<p><img src="images/latex/phongsEqnPt1.svg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
        <p>where I<sub>s</sub> is equal to the specular reflectance, which will be defined.
		</p>
        <p>For the final component, the specular reflectance depends on the direction of viewing (V) and material. For an ideal reflector, specular reflectance can only be observed when V = R, where R is the direction of a perfectly reflected light ray. However, for real objects, the maximum intensity occurs at this angle, but specular reflectance can still be observed over a range of values of <img src="images/latex/alpha.svg" width="10" height="20">, where <img src="images/latex/alpha.svg" width="10" height="20"> = the angle between V and R. We define the following variables:
		<ul>
		  <li><img src="images/latex/unitV.svg" width="20" height="20"> - direction vector for viewing direction (unit vector)
		  <li><img src="images/latex/unitR.svg" width="20" height="20"> - direction of specular reflectance (unit vector)
		  <li><img src="images/latex/latexN.svg" width="15" height="15"> - specular exponent/shininess - constant which models specular reflectance for a material
        </ul>
		<p>Phong observed that the shinier the surface, the smaller the specular highlight, and so the smaller the range of <img src="images/latex/alpha.svg" width="10" height="20"> over which it could be observed. The specular reflectance is proportional to <img src="images/latex/cosAlpha.svg" width="35" height="20">, and so using the scalar dot product and unit direction vectors for V and R again, we can calculate the intensity of specular reflectance, giving the final BRDF:
		  <br><img src="images/latex/phongsEqnPt2.svg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
		</p>

		<p>If there are multiple light sources, the BRDF can be altered so we sum the non-ambient components for all lights.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">Advantages of the Phong model</p>
		<p>The main advantage of the Phong model is that it is fairly simple to compute, and so provides an efficient way of rendering light reflectance on surfaces, whilst also being relatively simple to implement. This has made it very popular to use. Other models have built on Phong's model, such as the Blinn-Phong model, which makes the assumption that the viewer and light source are at infinity, speeding up the computation time. <!-- FIND REFERENCE -->
		</p>

		<p class="lead">Limitations of the Phong model</p>
		<p>One problem with using the Phong model to render scratched metals is that it assumes specular highlights are of the same colour as the light source, which does not hold true for metals in particular, although it is true for dielectrics. Other more advanced models, such as the <a href="cookTorranceModel.html">Cook-Torrance model</a> do not suffer from this problem, as they take the colour contribution from the surface into account, making the Phong model weaker at rendering metals in comparison. <!-- https://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/illumin/similum0.htm -->
		</p>
        </p>Another issue with the Phong model is that it does not satisfy one of the main BRDF properties, as it is not energy conserving, creating more light than it receives. This means the Phong model is physically incorrect, as it is based on physical observation rather than physics, using Phong's informal observations of light reflectance. For example, the constants <image src="images/latex/latexN.svg" width="13" height="13"> and k<sub>s</sub> which are used to model specular reflectance have no physical meaning, instead being adjusted by the user to achieve the highlight intensity they want.
		</p>
		<p>The Phong model also does not satisfy the reciprocal property of a BRDF, as the surface is modelled to reflect light in one directly different than in the other, when the angle of incidence and reflected angles are swapped. This is not physically possible, and so means the Phong model is physically incorrect.

		</p>
		<p class="lead">Additional/Phong shading</p>
		<p>In Phong's paper, he also described a method for rendering polygons using interpolation, known as Phong shading, which produces smoother shading of surfaces, reducing the Mach Band effect, where the contrast of colour between polygon edges is exaggerated. This technique is still used today in rendering.

		<h1 class="mt-5">Lambertian Model</h1> <!-- https://www.slideserve.com/maya/real-time-rendering -->
		<p class="lead">What is a Lambertian surface?</p>
    <p>The Lambertian model emulates the reflection of a Lambertian surface. Surfaces that are Lambertian have the same radiance from any
      direction of view, meaning that it’s radiance is isotropic and that the surface reflects light equally in all directions. Surfaces
       which are Lambertian can be also be called ideal diffusion surfaces or ideal matte surfaces. [1]</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="lead">Lambert's Cosine Law</p>
    <p> All Lambertian surfaces obey this law. This law states that the radiant intensity observed from an ideally diffusely reflecting
      surface is directly proportional to the cosine of angle &Theta;, which is between the surface normal and the observer’s line of sight. </p>
      <p><center><img src="images/cosinerule.png" alt="cosine rule" width="25%"></center></p>
      <div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.1 : Lambert's Cosine Law</p></div>

      <p>Equation Variables [2]:
        <ul>
        <li> I<sub>&Theta;</sub> is the intensity of the scattered ray of light at angle &Theta;, where &Theta; is the angle of the scattered ray from the surface normal
        <li> I<sub>n</sub> is the incident light intensity normal to the surface of the material
        <li> &Theta; is the angle between the surface normal and the light ray incoming light ray
        </ul></p>

      <p><center><img src="images/lambreflection.png" width="40%"></center></p>
      <div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.2 : Diagram showing relationship between Lambertian reflection and Lambert's cosine rule [3]</p></div>

      <br/>
      <p class="lead">BRDF of the Lambertian Model</p>
      <p> The BRDF of this model is a constant. This is because the amount of
        light scattered in each angle is the same, and hence does not depend
        on the outgoing ray angle (the viewing direction). The BRDF is shown below. &rho;
      is the reflectivity of the surface. Reflectivity ranges from 0, meaning that the material
    is completely absorbing, to 1, meaning that the material is completely reflecting. [4]</p>
        <p><center><img src="images/brdflamb.png" width="24%"></center></p>

        <br/>
        <p class="lead">Mathematical proof that the radiance is the same in any
          viewing direction</p>

          <p>This is the formal definition of radiance, where &#921; represents the Intensity
            and Acos(&Theta;) represents SOMETHING</p>

          <p><center><img src="images/radiancedef.png" width="20%"></center></p>

          <p> We want to find the radiance at the normal of the surface, so we substitute
            &Theta; = 0 into the equation. This gives us the equation below. </p>

          <p><center><img src="images/substituteLamb.png" width="16%"></center></p>

          <p>Next, we apply the Lambert’s cosine law, and substitute I<sub>n</sub>cos(&Theta;) for I<sub>&Theta;</sub>, and by
            rearranging the equation, we see that the reflected radiance no longer depends on &Theta;, and
            hence the radiance is the same in any viewing direction. </p>

          <p><center><img src="images/rearrangeLamb.png" width="40%"></center></p>
          <br/>
      <p class="lead">Evaluation of the Lambertian Model</p>
      <p> One of the assumptions of this model is that the surface is a perfect diffuse reflector. In real life, these
        materials don't exist. Some of the light, in reality, may be absorbed by the surface. Alternatively, some light
        may be reflected in a reduced specular reflection.</p>
      <p> The Lambertian Model is good for modelling matte surfaces such as clay, paper etc. Metals tend to have
        more specular reflections due to it's reflective nature, hence, the Lambertian model may not be the right model
        to use to render metals.</p>
