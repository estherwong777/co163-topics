		<!-- personal pages - write few points about technical background, few sentences about personal interests in this topic, why you are interested, most exciting thing -->
	    <p>Hi, I'm Jasmine and I am currently an undergraduate Computing student at Imperial College London. I was born in Malaysia, but have lived in the UK for the past 17 years. My personal interests include drawing, painting, and music. However, from a young age, I have been fascinated by computer science, due to its significance as a driver of change and innovation. Taking Computing for A Level allowed me to discover more about the subject and further fuelled by desire to learn computer science, as I especially enjoyed the satisfaction gained from solving problems. For my A Level Computing course, I learnt Pascal, as well as picking up some basic HTML, CSS and Python in my own time.
		<!--I had read a few books and was interested in topics such as quantum computing, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence. I also participated in summer courses such as a Computing and Microelectronics course, during which my group works to design, build and programan autonomous robot to navigate an arena and pick up boxes by using QR codes for navigation. These experiences fuelled my desire to continue learning computer science. -->
		</p>
		<p>At university, I have learnt to use Haskell and Java to create programs, as well as picking up useful technologies such as Git and SQL. I also recently took part in IC Hack, during which my team created our very first Android application: a Space Invaders-style game with voice and touch control [<a href="github.com/christophergunadi/fireichack/">x</a>]. During this, I learnt how to use the Android SDK and became familiar with using the Andriod Emulator for development, testing and debugging. The feeling of working together to create something was very exciting to me, and whilst working on the project, I got to learn many new things, including requesting user permissions and processing audio, as well as some things which hadn't even been covered in our lectures yet, such as the use of threads. In the future, I will be taking part in IC HealthHack, and am currently learning to use Unity for game development and graphic modelling.
		</p>
		<p>
		  I continue to be inspired by the potential and variety of programs I can build, and I hope to one day become a software engineer and improve the lives of others through my knowledge. For now, I strive to constantly be learning new things, new technologies, and continuing to challenge myself.
		</p>

		<h1 class="mt-5">Why this topic?</h1>
		<p>This topic initially interested me due to my experience using Unity, in which I used shaders to render various objects in a scene. Despite often just downloading shaders for rendering the surface appearances of objects, I wondered how they worked and about the different ways in which objects could be rendered. Therefore, when the opportunity to further learn about this in a project came up, I was very excited. I found the various ways of modelling light and comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the different models very interesting during my research, and it was fascinating to see how light models have developed over time, with people building on existing models to improve them, or trying to approach the rendering problem in a different way. Additionally, I really enjoyed learning about the physics of rendering light, and it was particularly interesting to see how deeply the models thought about the physics behind rendering, ensuring energy conservation and using the concepts of reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
		</p>
		<p>For me, the most exciting part of this project was testing some of the models out in Unity and being able to visually see how each constant parameter in the models corresponded to some visual aspect in the rendered object. Doing this aided me greatly in understanding what different parts of the model meant and how it all combined and represented the different types of reflectance.
		<!--putting the information we had learnt from our research into practice to render objects.??? -->
