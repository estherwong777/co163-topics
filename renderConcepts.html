      <h1 class="mt-5">Geometric aspect of modelling</h1> <!--- Chris' part --->
      <p> In computer graphics, we generate scratch geometries with several parameters.
        This include the material properties of the metal (hardness, roughness, etc.),
        the geometry of the tool used to scratch, and the orientation of the scratch
        relative to the surface normal. </p>
      <p> However, before we are able to generate such scratch geometries, there has been
        many tests that involve the measurement of real-world scratches. This allows us to
        obtain a physically correct behaviour for rendering these scratches. Measurements
        can be accomplished with the Hommelwerke Hommel-Tester T2000 (shown in the figure below).
        This device allows the testing of the various parameters that determine the scratch
        geometry such as the force applied by the tool, and the shape of the tool.  </p>
      <p> Based upon the results of real-world measurements, we will be able to build an
        analytical model that is flexible and to avoid using empirical methods in the future. </p>

      <p> Hommelwerke Hommel-Tester T2000 from: ....</p>

      <p> When analysing real-world scratches, we are going to focus on two geometries: </p>

      <ol>
        <li> The profile of the scratches (not visible to the naked eye) which can be
          determined by analysing the cross-section geometry of the scratch. </li>
        <li> The trajectory of the scratches (visible to the naked eye) which can be
          given in the form of simple curves. </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="lead"><b>Scratch profile</b></p>

      <p> The cross-section geometry of a scratch is composed of a groove (or trough)
          and two peaks (as shown in the image below). </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The groove is due to the penetration of the tool into the material. </p>
        <li> The peak is due to the flow and pile-up of material during penetration
          of the tool into the material. </p>
      </ul>

      <p> The shape of the groove and the internal zones of the peaks are dependent
        on the geometry of the tool. In metals, it is safe to assume that this dependency
        is direct as metals have no significant shape recovery after a scratch
        (i.e. the shape of the groove will closely resemble the shape of the scratching tool). </p>

      <img src="images/scratchprofile.png" alt="Scratch Profile Diagram" width="50%">
      <p> Cross section geometry of a scratch (original)</p>

      <p> For mathematical simplicity, we are going to assume that there is no loss of material
        (i.e. the sum of areas of the peak is equal to the area of the groove) and
        that the two peaks have equal areas. </p>
      <p> The depth, d, of the scratch is the depth of the groove from the surface baseline, p.
        It is found to be directly related to the force applied with the tool and the material
        properties of the object, especially hardness. </p>
      <p> From the figure, we can see that there are two angles ALPHA and BETA. This can be measured
        from the cross sectional geometry generated. By knowing that the sum of the areas of the two
        peaks is equal to the area, A, of the groove, with basic trigonometry we are able to find a
        relation between h, A, ALPHA and BETA. </p>
      <p> INSERT EQ HERE </p>

      <p class="lead"><b>Trajectory of scratches</b></p>
      <p> The location of the scratches is also needed to fully characterise the scratches. To do this,
        a 2D texture mapping technique can be used. The picture shown below is essentially a two-colour map.
        The different colours represents the type of surfaces. In this case, the darker colour represents
        the non-scratched surfaces while the lighter colour represents the scratches. This information
        is used to change the BRDF at that point. </p>

      <p> A complete description of the geometry of the surface is important in determining the BRDF,
        which is used by the computer to determine how light is reflected on every point on the surface. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="mt-5">Reflective aspect of modelling</h1>
	    <p class="lead"><b>What is a BRDF?</b></p>
	    <p> A BRDF is a function that defines the amount of light reflected in the view direction for a given incident and
        outgoing light direction. These directions are taken in a co-ordinate system where the surface normal (n) acts as the z-axis.
      </p>
      <p> The BRDF formal definition is as follows (first defined by Fred Nicodemus)[1] : </p>
      <img src="images/brdfequation.png" alt="BRDF equation" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
      <p> Equation variables </p>
        <ul>
         <li> L is the radiance (power from the source per area into a certain solid angle)
           </li>
         <li> E is the irradiance (power recieved by a surface per unit area)
           </li>
         <li> &Theta;<sub>i</sub> is the angle between w<sub>i</sub> and n
            </li>
          <li> w<sub>i</sub> is the direction of the incident ray
        </li>
        <li> w<sub>r</sub> is the direction of the reflected ray
        </ul>

    <img src="images/brdf.png" alt="BRDF diagram" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
    <p><center>Figure 2.1 : Diagram showing vectors used in the BRDF definition [3]</center></p>

		<p>Many rendering models like Cook-Torrance, are examples of BRDFs. Many BRDFs have
      been proposed other the years: some are designed to model a specific type of material.
      For example the Oren-Nayar model is suited to model the surface of the moon, which
       does not reflect light like a diffuse surface would. (diffuse surfaces scatter light
        at many angle when incident with one ray).
		</p>
    <p> BRDF's have 3 key properties [2] : </p>
      <ul>
       <li>BRDF is a positive function, meaning that for all define inputs of the function,
         the output is positive.
         </li>
       <li>BRDF is reciprocal. In other words, BRDF(ω<sub>i</sub>,ω<sub>r</sub>) = BRDF(ω<sub>r</sub>,ω<sub>i</sub>) if you swap
         the incoming and outgoing direction in the function, the function returns the same result.
         </li>
       <li>Finally, a BRDF is energy conserving. This means that the BRDF can not create more light t
         han it receives. This is because an object cannot reflect more light than the amount of light
         incident on its surface. (unless the surface is emissive, which is an exception)
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead"><b>What is a normal map?</b></p>
      <p>In geometry, the normal is a vector or that’s perpendicular to a surface or an object. Normal map creates the illusion of depth detail on the surface of a model.
        A normal map uses RGB information that corresponds directly with the X, Y and Z axis in 3D space (R for X , G for Y and B for Z). This RGB information tells the 3D
         redenering applications how the direction of the surface normals are oriented in for every polygon in the image.
         These orientations, also known as normals, tell the 3D applications how the polygon should be shaded.
      </p>
      <p> While normal maps cannot represent extremely irregular geometry, they are capable of rendering small indents and bumps
          along a flat surface. Hence, it would be suitable for rendering scratched metals. Normal maps do not add any real geometry,
          but they use the colors to create highlights and shadows that would be present if there were more geometry.

      <p class="lead"><b>The use of Frensel's equations</b><p>
        <p> Fresnel's equations are used to render transparent objects which both refract and reflect light. Metals are mostly reflective,
          while dielectric materials like glass have more refraction than metals. Light is composed of two perpendicular
          waves are called the parallel and the perpendicular polarised light. In order to know the ratio of reflected and refracted light,
          we use these two equations to calculate the ratio of each of the two waves. [7]

        <p> By averaging these two computed formulas, we get a ratio F<sub>r</sub> of the reflected light. </p>


      <p class="lead"><b>Introduction to microfacets</b></p>
      <p><b>Diffuse reflection</b>: When light that is incident on a surface scatters at various angles rather than just one (specular reflection).

      <p><b>Specular reflection</b>: light is perfectly reflected in a mirror-like way from the light source to the viewer. This occurs when the surface normal
         is oriented exactly halfway between the direction of incident light and the direction of the viewer. </p>

      <p><b>Specular highlights</b>: bright spot of light that appears on shiny objects when illuminated </p>

      <p> The above image shows the effects of microfacets in metal reflections. The leftmost sphere is
        specular, but the ones near the right contain microfacets which blurr the specular highlights.

    <p><center>Figure 2.6 : Diffuse vs. Specular reflections [9]</center></p>
  </br>

      <p>Many shiny objects show blurred specular highlights. This can be explained by the existence of microfacets and
        the concept of diffuse reflections. We assume that surfaces contain many tiny facets and are not perfectly smooth.
        Therefore, each individual light ray reaches the material surface at different orientations. Hence,
        the rays reflect in various directions, creating a diffuse reflection effect. [8] There are many microfacet models which have
        been very successful at modelling light reflection from rough surfaces. Eg. <a href="cookTorranceModel.html" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Cook-Torrance model</a>
